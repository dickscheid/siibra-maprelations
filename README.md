The graph below illustrated spatial relationships of brain regions in two different parcellations, the *Julich-Brain probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps* and the *Virtual Epileptic Patient map* (VEP). The relationships have been mapped in MNI152 space using [siibra-python](https://github.com/FZJ-INM1-BDA/siibra-python).

- Blue circles denote Julich-Brain regions, yellow circles denote VEP regions
- Circle radius is proportionaly to volume of brain regions
